# NeTEx-Profile-EPIP
Data4PT (Programme SUpport Action for Transmodel implementation) provides an XSD that adapts to European Passenger Information profile (EPIP). 
This tool aims to enable datasets validation against this minimum EU profile while also to be used as a base for national profiles specification, depending on national needs.
